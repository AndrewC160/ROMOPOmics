Description: ROMOPOmics facilitates adding sequencing-type ('Omics) data into 
    the OMOP data model, as well as incorporation of that data into an SQLite 
    database for ease of use with existing healthcare or research data systems. 
    Users can use ROMOPOmics to define and maintain a database that can be made 
    readily available to other team members, stream lining the sharing of data 
    and resources between multiple projects.
