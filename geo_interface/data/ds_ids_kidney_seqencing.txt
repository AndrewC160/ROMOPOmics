1. Estrogen dependent CD4+ T cell specific transcriptomic pathways identified in premenopausal protection against hypertension
(Submitter supplied) Background: Premenopausal females are protected against T cell-dependent immune activation and development of angiotensin II (Ang II) hypertension compared to males and postmenopausal females. Therefore, the current study hypothesized that specific CD4+ T cell pathways are regulated by estrogen signlaing and Ang II, and contribute to sex differences in T cell cytokine secretion and renal inflammation. more...

2. Targeting Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) responsive pathways in the control of renal phosphate and vitamin D metabolism
(Submitter supplied) FGF23 is a bone-derived hormone that mediates renal phosphate reabsorption and 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D metabolism via its required co-receptor alpha-Klotho (KL).  The functional pathways guiding this hormoneâ€™s activity in kidney have not been studied extensively, and whether using other factors with overlapping signaling profiles to produce FGF23-like responses is unclear. To map FGF23-related genes, gene array and single-cell RNA sequencing were utilized on wild type mouse kidneys. more...

3. Next-generation sequencing reveals size-dependent pulmonary impact of thin graphene oxide sheets in mice: towards safe-by-design
(Submitter supplied) Safety assessment of graphene-based materials (GBMs) including graphene oxide (GO) is essential for their safe use across many sectors of society. In particular, the link between specific material properties and biological effects needs to be further elucidated. Here we compared the effects of lateral dimensions of GO sheets in acute and chronic pulmonary responses after single intranasal instillation in mice. more...

4. Cortical kidney bulk RNA Sequencing in the reversible unilateral ureter obstruction model.
(Submitter supplied) The kidney has limited capacity to regenerate following injury and preferentially repairs chronic injury with secreted extracellular matrix proteins.  This can be a progressive process with functioning kidney tissue being replaced detrimentally with fibrotic scar tissue, ultimately leading to kidney failure.  Using the reversible unilateral ureteric obstruction model, a model of reversable injury, we describe the transcriptomic changes that occur during obstructive renal injury and subsequent repair.

5. Tumour-associated microglia/macrophages in Glioblastoma are heterogenous and display higher immunological reactivity under aconitate decarboxylase 1 deficiency
(Submitter supplied) In Glioblastoma (GBM), tumour-associated microglia/macrophages (TAMs) represent the most abundant cells of the stromal compartment contributing to tumour immune escape mechanisms. Thus, strategies targeting TAMs are emerging as promising objectives for immunotherapy. However, TAMs heterogeneity is only starting to emerge and little is known about their contribution to GBM progression. Here, we comprehensively study the  molecular changes of TAMs in the GL261 GBM mouse model by single-cell RNA-sequencing across GBM progression and in the absence of Acod1/Irg1, a key gene involved in macrophage metabolic reprogramming. more...

9. Single cell RNA seq of hepatic and renal p16 positive cells
(Submitter supplied) We performed the single cell RNA sequencing of mouse normal kidney, normal liver, and NASH-induced liver from p16-tdTomato mice. In order to enrich p16 positive cells, we independently sorted the non-separated cells (including both of p16 positive and negative cells) and p16 positive cells alone through tdTomato intensity by FACS. By obtaining 13,876 single cell transcripts, after the graph-based clustering and marker genes defined cell type classification, we identified the heterogeneity of in vivo p16-positive cells which dispersedly existed in renal cells and non-parenchymal hepatic cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) Female sex protects against development of acute kidney injury (AKI). While sex hormones may be involved in protection, the role of differential gene expression is unknown. We conducted gene profiling in male and female mice with or without kidney ischemia-reperfusion injury. Mice underwent bilateral renal pedicle clamping (30 min), and tissues were collected 24 hours after reperfusion. RNA-sequencing was performed on proximal tubules and kidney endothelial cells. more...

In this study, we demonstrate that SC-Î² cells can acquire mature gene signatures via transplantation in mice for 6 months. MAFA, a marker for mature Î² cells, is expressed and resulted in significant improvements in insulin release and glucose regulation in diabetic mice.

17. JAML deficiency protects against diabetic kidney disease through modulating podocyte lipid metabolism.
(Submitter supplied) Podocytes, highly differentiated glomerular epithelial cells, are essential for the maintenance of glomerular filtration barrier. Lipid accumulation in podocytes is a major determinant of proteinuric kidney disease. By RNA-sequencing analysis, we observed the significant changes of genes important in regulating cellular lipid homeostasis in podocytes with HG treatment. We generated two mouse podocyte cell lines stably transduced with either a sh-NC lentiviral construct or a shRNA lentiviral construct designed to target JAML RNA to investigate the consequences on the gene expression profile of JAML knockdown in  mouse podocytes.

18. Identification and Characterization of Cellular Heterogeneity within the Developing Renal Interstitium
(Submitter supplied) Kidney formation requires the coordinated growth of multiple cell types including the collecting ducts, nephrons, vasculature and interstitium. We show that during development, the interstitium is a highly heterogeneous, patterned population of cells that occupies distinct positions correlated to the adjacent parenchyma. Our analysis indicates that the heterogeneity is not a mere reflection of different stages in a linear developmental trajectory but instead represents several novel differentiated cell states. more...
