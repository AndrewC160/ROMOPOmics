# Creating a database of 1

Let's say we have a cancer patient Sally that has undergone treatment and genomic testing. If we have that information available to us, we can generate her own database of clinical and 'omics data.

# Data Model

```{r loadDataModel,echo=TRUE}

dm <- loadDataModel(as_table_list = FALSE)

```

# Input Data

We need to have a matrix of information for Sally

```{r data_generation}

df <- 
data.frame(
  "patient" = "Sally",
  "cancer" = "ovarian",
  "subtype" = "endometrioid",
  "cancer_report" = "MSK Impact report",
  "specimen" = "follicle",
  "specimen_id" = "123456"
  )

df %>% write_csv("../data/Nof1.csv")

```
